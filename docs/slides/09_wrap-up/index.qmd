# Odds and ends

## Choosing the right approach {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
How do I know what test to use on my data? How do I know whether authors have used the right test?
:::

*What do you want to generalize to?*

If there is more than one population (subjects and stimuli), linear mixed-effects modeling is really your only choice

*What type of data do you have?*

- is your dependent variable continuous, binary, count, ordinal?
- do you have multi-level or single-level data? 
  **REMEMBER: multi-level means multiple measurements on the DV for the same sampling units (subjects, stimuli)**
- do you have pseudoreplications (multiple measurements on the same DV for the same sampling units under the same conditions)?
- are your predictors categorical or continuous?

## four functions to rule them all

1. Is the data single- or multi-level?
2. Is the response continuous or discrete?
3. How are the observations distributed?

| structure | response  | distrib | R fnc           |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| single    | cont      | normal  | `base::lm()`    |
| single    | cont/disc | various | `base::glm()`   |
| multi     | cont      | normal  | `lme4::lmer()`  |
| multi     | cont/disc | various | `lme4::glmer()` |

## Correspondences between GLM / conventional techniques

::: {.notes}
- you need to know the conventional approaches as well
  to read the literature of the last 50 years
- sometimes the conventional approach is all you need (analytic
  solution, no convergence problems)
- most conventional techniques assume continuous data, but data in
  psychology is rarely truly continuous
:::

Most conventional techniques are not built to handle *pseudoreplications*. If you have them, remove them by calculating means for each sampling unit, and perform your test on the means.

But if the source of these pseudoreplications is multiple stimuli over which you would like to generalize, then you *can't* remove them by calculating means.

## Multivariate situations

What do you do when you have more than one DV?

::: {.notes}
- DVs are correlated, so tests are not independent
- there are proper multivariate tests (MANOVA) but complex and have limitations
::: 

*solution*: fit separate univariate models, one for each DV,
correcting for the familywise error rate (e.g., Bonferroni)

(see also: multivariable multiple regression)

## Final exam

- Don't leave errors in your code, check all validation tests
- Don't wait until the last minute to upload your assignment
- Be familiar with Moodle
  
- How to study?
  - watch out for the 'illusion of understanding'
  - use teams for further Q&A
