## Statistical (& "Scientific") Models

- Semester One: 
  *How do I translate a study design into a statistical model for analysis?*

- Semester Two: 
  *How do I develop an idea and translate it into a study design?*

## The approach

We want our analyses to be:

1. reproducible
2. transparent
3. generalizable
4. flexible

- punching buttons on a microwave (pre-packaged food)
- versus taking fresh ingredients and improvising something

- violation of assumptions
  - especially: independence
- discretization of predictors
- treating categorical data as continuous
- over-aggregation
- mindless statistics

## What do they have in common?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- t-test
- correlation & regression
- multiple regression
- analysis of variance
- mixed-effects modeling
:::

::: {.column width="40%" .fragment}
- All are special cases of the General Linear Model (GLM).

## GLM approach

1. Define a mathematical model representing the processes that are
   assumed to give rise to the data
2. Estimate the parameters of the model
3. Validate the model
4. Transparently report what you did
   - share your code
   - anonymize and share your data (ethics permitting)

## Models are just... models

A statistical model is a *simplification* and *idealization* of reality that captures our key assumptions about the processes underlying data (the *data generating process* or DGP).

## Importance of data simulation

- Data simulation is a *litmus test* of understanding a statistical approach.
  - Can you generate simulated data that would meet the assumptions of the approach?
    - If not, *you don't understand it (yet!)*

- Being able to specify the DGP is key to study planning (power)

## Example: Parent reflexes

Does being the parent of a toddler sharpen your reflexes?

- simple response time to a flashing light
- dependent (response) variable: mean RT for each parent

## Simulating data

```{r}
set.seed(2021) # RNG seed: arbitrary integer value
parents <- rnorm(n = 50, mean = 480, sd = 40)

parents
```

## Control group

```{r}
set.seed(2021) # RNG seed: arbitrary integer value
parents <- rnorm(n = 50, mean = 480, sd = 40)

parents
control <- rnorm(n = 50, mean = 500, sd = 40)

control
```

## $t$-test

```{r}
t.test(parents, control, var.equal = TRUE)
```

## Analysis of variance (ANOVA)

```{r}
dat <- tibble(
  group = rep(c("parent", "control"), 
              c(length(parents), length(control))),
  rt = c(parents, control))

dat
```

--- 

```{r}
summary(aov(rt ~ group, dat))    
```

## Regression

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + e_i$$

$$e_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$

---

```{r}
summary(lm(rt ~ group, dat))
```

## 

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_app(url = "https://rstudio-connect.psy.gla.ac.uk/GLM", height = "700px")
```

## Single- vs Multi-level data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
tibble(sub = 1:6,
       A = rep(c("A1", "A2"), each = 3),
       Y = round(rnorm(6, 800, 100))) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
tibble(sub = rep(1:2, each = 3),
       stim = rep(LETTERS[1:3], 2),
       A = rep(c("A1", "A2"), each = 3),
       Y = round(rnorm(6, 800, 100))) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

## Issues with multi-level data

- GLMs assume independence of residuals
- Observations within a cluster (unit) are not independent
- Any sources of non-independence must be modeled (we'll learn this later!) or aggregated away
- Typical consequence of failing to do so: High false positives

## Regression: Killer App

| technique        | t-test | ANOVA | regression |
|:-----------------|-------:|------:|-----------:|
| Categorical IVs  | ✓      | ✓     | ✓          |
| Continuous DVs   | ✓      | ✓     | ✓          |
| Continuous IVs   |        | -     | ✓          |
| Multi-level data | -      | -     | ✓          |
| Categorical DVs  |        |       | ✓          |
| Unbalanced data  | -      | -     | ✓          |
| >1 sampling unit |        |       | ✓          |

## Four functions to rule them all

1. Is the data single- or multi-level?
2. Is the response continuous or discrete?
3. How are the observations distributed?

| structure | response  | distribution | R function      |
|:----------|:----------|:-------------|:----------------|
| single    | cont      | normal       | `base::lm()`    |
| single    | cont/disc | various      | `base::glm()`   |
| multi     | cont      | normal       | `lme4::lmer()`  |
| multi     | cont/disc | various      | `lme4::glmer()` |
